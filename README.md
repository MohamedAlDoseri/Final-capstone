1. Project Overview

This study analyzes football players from European top 5 leagues. The assesment and review aims to uncover insights on overall on-field productivity in relation to player market value. It explores playing time, goal contributions, age, and physical attributes and their effect on transfermarket valuation between 2014 to 2022. The findings will be relevant to scouts, footbball clubs and general sports analysists for their performance evaluations. 

2. Problem Statement 

Footbal clubs make significant investments in recruitment with an aim of making better teams in competitive matches. However, it is worth noting that market value is influenced by multiple factors which include appearances, and goal contributions. This study dives into these crucial performance metrics which influence player valuation.

3. Aim of the Study
To evaluate how player’s on-field contributions and appearance translates to player market valuation across European top 5 leagues.

4. Data Descrpition
The datset is for Leagues: Top 5 European leagues 
Consits of Unique players: 24177
400,000+ player market valuations historical records
1,200,000+ player appearance records from all games
1.2 Million Appearances
Time period: 2014–2022
Main Features : 23
Key variables: goals, assists, minutes played, player position, age, height, and market value

5. Methodology
 Data cleaning and preprocessing 
Feature engineering using python pandas dataframe. Contributions (goals +assists), value for money(contributions per market value)
Exploratory data analysis and data visualization
ANOVA testing to compare goal contribution within and across groups (posistions)
Regression modeling to expalin key factors in player value and productivity

6. Findings
Player market value is positively associated with goals, assists, and playing time
Age has a strong negative relationship with market value
Player position significantly affects goal contribution per 90 minutes

7. Dahboard Usage
Use power BI
Filter by position and year
Player performance metrics comparison
Value for money indicators 

8. Limitations
The study and model does not include injury length, suspensions and contracts specifications
Clubs legacy and achievements may influence market value
The results are associations mostly
